This is an on-board ROS2 (Jazzy, and before - Humble) software, normally residing under Ubuntu Server on a Raspberry Pi.

Its Gazebo Simulation side runs on a desktop - see https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/tree/main/Docs/ROS-Jazzy

The origin of most code here is _Articulated Robotics_ by Josh Newans, a mechatronics engineer from Newcastle, Australia.
